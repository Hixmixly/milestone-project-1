The initial goal for this was to create a zelda like browser game with several areas. But then downscaled to a sort of survival game where enamies would poor out of the casle. For the final version it's like flappy bird but instead of just avoiding the pipes enimies would come from the other side of the screen and attack. To score you just have to keep moving forward and see how long you last.
